## üìã Progress Log

### 2025-10-26 | Objective 1: Export Logic Refactor ‚úÖ

**Goal:** Mobile-first clarity in export flows

**Tasks:**
- [x] Audit current export button layout and mobile responsiveness
- [x] Consolidate export actions into unified mobile menu
- [x] Add visual feedback for export operations
- [x] Optimize touch targets for mobile (min 44px)
- [x] Test on various viewport sizes

**Implementation:**
- Created full-screen mobile export menu with backdrop
- Consolidated all export actions (6 functions) into single menu
- Added descriptive icons and helper text for each action
- Implemented proper touch targets (52px height)
- Added loading states and success/error toasts (‚úì/‚úó)
- Separated export actions by category (Export/Session)
- Desktop layout remains clean with all buttons in footer
- Menu includes scroll support for future expansion

**Symbolic Checkpoint:** _The stream flows through all channels_ ‚úì
