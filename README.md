# 🌌 BeatGrid Genesis – Modular Development Hub

Welcome to the constellation of creativity powering BeatGrid Genesis. This repo hosts modular components, symbolic UX panels, and branching workflows designed for generative music architecture and executive-grade clarity.

## 🔧 Project Structure

- `main` – Stable release branch
- `p1/*` – Priority 1 development branches
- `feature/*` – New features under active development
- `experiment/*` – Claude’s sandbox branches
- `fix/*` – Bug fixes and visual tweaks

## 🧭 Merge Protocol

All merges must follow the symbolic merge ritual:
1. Create a pull request with a poetic anchor phrase
2. Pass visual and functional tests
3. Update `p1-status.md` with merge status

## 🧪 Experimental Branches

Claude’s exploratory work lives in `experiment/*`. These branches are reviewed for symbolic resonance and modular integrity before merging.
