## 🌟 P1 Milestone Achieved

All Priority 1 branches have been reviewed, merged, and integrated into the BeatGrid Studio Edition. This marks the completion of the first modular constellation, aligning UX clarity, audio sync, and motif-driven design.

Claude’s contributions have been symbolically merged and documented in [`p1-status.md`](./p1-status.md).

_“Merge complete. Constellation aligned.”_



# MusicWebApp
Webapp for building drum patterns, leads, rhythm 
# 🌌 BeatGrid Genesis – Modular Development Hub

Welcome to the constellation of creativity powering BeatGrid Genesis. This repo hosts modular components, symbolic UX panels, and branching workflows designed for generative music architecture and executive-grade clarity.

# 🌌 BeatGrid — Studio Edition

BeatGrid is a modular, motif-driven generative music interface designed for clarity, creativity, and recalibration. Built with Tailwind CSS and Tone.js, it offers a constellation of interactive panels for composing rhythmic patterns, harmonic progressions, and melodic motifs — all within a studio-grade aesthetic.

---

## 🎛️ Features

- **Modular Step Sequencer**: 32-step grid for drums, bass, and leads with visual feedback and smooth transitions.
- **Studio-Themed UI**: Custom Tailwind theme with `studio` color palette, glowing accents, and soft shadows.
- **Tone.js Integration**: Real-time audio synthesis and playback with tempo control and pattern sequencing.
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-first design with adaptive grid columns and hover-enhanced interactions.
- **Export & Share**: Save JSON patterns or push to GitHub Gist with one tap.
- **LLM Formatting Tools**: Buttons to format selections for language model input or randomize patterns for inspiration.

## 🧩 UI Architecture

BeatGrid is composed of three primary panels:

| Panel         | Purpose                        | Notes                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `Drum Kits`   | Percussive patterns            | 2 bars, 32 steps               |
| `Bass & Rhythm` | Harmonic hints and progressions | Supports tonal layering        |
| `Leads / Motifs` | Melodic scales and degrees     | Symbolic motif generation      |

Each panel uses `.card` containers with fade-in animations and hover-responsive styling. Steps are toggled with `.step.on` classes, triggering accent glows and audio playback.

## 🎨 Design System

Tailwind config includes:

- **Color Palette**: `studio` (cool grays), `accent` (mint green), `glow` (soft teal)
- **Typography**: Inter font for display and body
- **Shadows**: `studio-soft` for depth and clarity
- **Animations**: `fadeIn` for smooth card entry

Custom CSS enhances buttons, sliders, icons, and grid elements with tactile feedback and symbolic glow effects.

## 🧠 LLM Integration

BeatGrid includes tools for AI-assisted composition:

- `Format for LLM`: Prepares selected patterns for prompt injection
- `Copy Selected`: Copies JSON for model input
- `Download JSON`: Saves selected modules for reuse or remixing

These tools support Claude and other agents in collaborative music generation workflows.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `index.html` in a browser
3. Tap `▶ Play` to begin composing
4. Use sliders, toggles, and export tools to refine your grid

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5 + Tailwind CSS**
- **Tone.js** for audio synthesis
- **Modular JS** (`data.js`, `icons.js`, `app.js`)
- **GitHub Gist API** (optional token required)

## 🧭 Merge Protocol

All development follows a symbolic branching ritual:

- `main` – Stable release
- `p1/*` – Priority 1 tasks
- `feature/*` – New modules
- `experiment/*` – Claude’s sandbox
- `fix/*` – Bug fixes

See [`p1-status.md`](./p1-status.md) for merge tracking.

## 🔧 Project Structure

- `main` – Stable release branch
- `p1/*` – Priority 1 development branches
- `feature/*` – New features under active development
- `experiment/*` – Claude’s sandbox branches
- `fix/*` – Bug fixes and visual tweaks

## 🧭 Merge Protocol

All merges must follow the symbolic merge ritual:
1. Create a pull request with a poetic anchor phrase
2. Pass visual and functional tests
3. Update `p1-status.md` with merge status

## 🧪 Experimental Branches

Claude’s exploratory work lives in `experiment/*`. These branches are reviewed for symbolic resonance and modular integrity before merging.
